Regrade Project 3

ERROR #1:
FILE - MAIN, LINE - 23
Problem with REGEX, used a * instead of a + and ended up only dealing with 2 names
Messed with edge cases such as "Jar Jar Binks" or "R2_D2"
Fixed by editing REGEX to use greedy modifier instead

ERROR #2:
FILE - MAIN, LINE - 41
Problem attempted to parse empty lines at end of line instead of skipping
Messed random spaces at ends of lines
Fixed by adding try catch to deal with NumberFormatExceptions that could only be caused by this case

ERROR #3:
FILE - MAIN, LINE - 75
Problem with REGEX, same as ERROR #1
Messed with commands being read in
Fixed by editing REGEX to use greedy modifier instead

ERROR #4:
FILE - MAIN, LINE - 80
Problem attempted to output invalid results
Messed with any case that had invalid input
Fixed by adding in a continue that was removed during testing
